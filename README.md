# Unsupervised-Learning-with-R
# Author: Vivian Katheu

I am a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and I'm currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). This project has been divided into four parts where I'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on my insights.

Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing my dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. I will perform my analysis and provide insights gained from the analysis.

Part 2: Feature Selection

This section requires me to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods. I will be required to perform my analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

Part 3: Association Rules

This section will require that I create association rules that will allow me to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. I am provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. I will provide insights for my analysis.

Part 4: Anomaly Detection

I have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.
